The Image Resizer script takes images from a specified directory, resizes them based on a given scale percentage, and saves the resized images to another directory. It utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing.

Install OpenCv:

``pip install opencv-python``

Place the images you want to resize in a directory named images within the project folder.

Run the script:

``python resize_images.py``

Adjust the scale_percentage parameter in the script to resize the images by the desired percentage.

The resized images will be saved in a directory named resized within the project folder.
